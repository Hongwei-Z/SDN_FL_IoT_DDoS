when doing security work:
 talk about model - what would be secure and insecure in our design. since its on gateways - is gateway secure device? explain to audience, first paper assumed that gateway was part of network and not need to worry about security

measured communication overhead, but his suggestion is its presented in overall bytes, he is interested in bandwidth of the number of bytes over time. 
 1. thats the normal number that people careabout in distributed fassion. 
 2. curious how it develops over time. higher consumption at start/end or when model is converging? 
    provide as a time series as its more useful. 
    israat --> standard how much distribution you save by model.
    


switch and server why not in controller.

parameter tuning --> discuss why we have 10 epochs.
